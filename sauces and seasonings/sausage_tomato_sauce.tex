\section*{Directions}

\noindent
Dice \textbf{onion} ---
Dice \textbf{carrots} fine ---
Mince \textbf{garlic} ---
Quarter \textbf{zucchini} lengthwise and slice into ¼-inch pieces ---
Drain \textbf{mushrooms} ---
Crush \textbf{San~Marzano~tomatoes} by hand ---
Open \textbf{red~wine} to breathe

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, brown \textbf{Italian~sausage} over medium-high heat, breaking into bite-sized pieces. Cook until well-browned and cooked through, about \textit{8-10~minutes}. Remove \textbf{sausage} with slotted spoon and set aside, leaving rendered fat in pot.
    
    \item Reduce heat to medium and add diced \textbf{onion} to the rendered fat. Cook until translucent and softened, about \textit{5~minutes}.
    
    \item Add diced \textbf{carrots} and cook for additional \textit{5~minutes}, stirring occasionally.
    
    \item Add minced \textbf{garlic}, sliced \textbf{zucchini}, and drained \textbf{mushrooms}. Cook for \textit{2-3~minutes} until \textbf{garlic} is fragrant.
    
    \item Pour in \textbf{red~wine} to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pot. Cook until wine reduces by half, about \textit{3-4~minutes}.
    
    \item Stir in \textbf{tomato~paste} and cook for \textit{1-2~minutes} until it darkens slightly and becomes fragrant.
    
    \item Add \textbf{Prego~sauce}, hand-crushed \textbf{San~Marzano~tomatoes} with their juices, \textbf{Italian~seasoning}, and \textbf{brown~sugar}. Return browned \textbf{sausage} to pot and stir to combine.
    
    \item Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered for \textit{2~hours}, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom to prevent sticking. Sauce should reduce and concentrate significantly.
    
    \item During final \textit{30~minutes}, add \textbf{lemon~juice}, and \textbf{chicken~stock} as needed if sauce becomes too thick. Taste and adjust with additional \textbf{brown~sugar} or \textbf{Italian~seasoning} as needed. 
    
    
    \item Serve immediately over pasta or cool completely before storing.

\subsection*{Ingredient Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use high-quality bulk \textbf{Italian~sausage} from butcher for best flavor
    \item San Marzano DOP tomatoes provide superior sweetness and acidity
    \item Crushing tomatoes by hand creates better texture than machine processing
    \item Use dry red wine you'd drink - \textbf{Merlot}, \textbf{Chianti}, or \textbf{Côtes~du~Rhône} work well
    \item \textbf{Italian~seasoning} should be basil and thyme heavy with oregano and touch of rosemary
    \item Fresh \textbf{lemon~juice} is essential for proper acid balance
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Preparation Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't skip browning the \textbf{sausage} - the fond creates essential flavor base
    \item Maintain gentle simmer throughout long cook to prevent scorching
    \item Stir occasionally and scrape bottom to prevent sticking
    \item Sauce should reduce by about one-third during \textit{2~hour} cook
    \item Taste and adjust seasoning progressively, not just at end
    \item Final consistency should coat pasta without being too thick
    \item Add \textbf{lemon~juice} off heat to preserve brightness
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Make Ahead \& Storage}

    \item Reheat gently, adding \textbf{chicken~stock} if needed to restore consistency
    \item Can double recipe easily for batch cooking
    \item Freeze in portion-sized containers for quick weeknight meals
    \item Add fresh \textbf{lemon~juice} when reheating for brightness
\end{itemize}

    \item Reserve pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed
    \item Garnish with fresh \textbf{basil}, \textbf{Parmesan}, and cracked pepper
    \item Pairs excellently with garlic bread and Caesar salad
    \item Makes enough sauce for \textit{1½~pounds} of pasta
