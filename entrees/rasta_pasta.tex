\subsection*{Equipment Required}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instant Pot or pressure cooker
    \item Large pasta pot (6-8 quart)
    \item Colander
    \item Large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven
    \item Wooden spoon or silicone spatula
    \item Measuring cups and spoons
    \item Sharp chef's knife
    \item Cutting board
    \item Box grater or microplane for cheese
    \item Two forks for shredding chicken
    \item Medium bowl for shredded chicken
    \item Small bowl for reserved broth
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mise en Place}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measure all seasonings and spices before beginning
    \item Allow heavy cream to come to room temperature
    \item Prepare all vegetables before starting to cook
    \item Grate cheese while chicken cooks in Instant Pot
    \item Have all ingredients within arm's reach before beginning sauce
    \item Keep pasta water heating while preparing the chicken
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ingredient Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Boneless chicken thighs provide more flavor and moisture than breast meat
    \item Store-bought jerk seasoning works well, but use a high-quality brand for authentic flavor
    \item For homemade jerk seasoning, combine allspice, thyme, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and salt
    \item Freshly grated Parmesan is crucial - pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents
    \item For extra heat, add 1-2 teaspoons of minced scotch bonnet or habanero pepper
    \item Bell peppers can be substituted with poblano for a slightly spicier version
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Preparation Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow a full natural release if time permits - it keeps the chicken more tender
    \item Reserve more cooking broth than called for in case the sauce needs thinning
    \item Don't overcook the pasta - it will continue to absorb liquid in the sauce
    \item For bell peppers, aim for softened but still slightly crisp for best texture
    \item If sauce becomes too thick, add a splash of reserved cooking broth
    \item If sauce is too thin, simmer a few extra minutes before adding pasta
    \item Keep pasta very al dente as it will continue cooking in the hot sauce
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Make Ahead \& Storage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chicken can be prepared up to \textit{2~days} ahead and refrigerated
    \item Complete dish keeps well refrigerated for up to \textit{3~days}
    \item When reheating, add a splash of chicken broth or cream to revive the sauce
    \item Reheat gently on stovetop over medium-low heat
    \item Microwave reheating works but may cause pasta to become slightly rubbery
    \item Freeze portions without pasta, then prepare fresh pasta when reheating
    \item Garnish with fresh cilantro only just before serving
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Serving Suggestions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Serve with fried plantains for an authentic Caribbean pairing
    \item A simple green salad with lime vinaigrette balances the rich pasta
    \item Garlic bread made with Caribbean-style butter is an excellent side
    \item For a complete meal, add a tropical fruit salad as a refreshing dessert
    \item Offer extra jerk seasoning at the table for those who prefer more heat
    \item Jamaican Red Stripe beer or a fruity rum punch complement the flavors
    \item For a colorful presentation, serve in a large white bowl to highlight the vibrant peppers
\end{itemize}
