# Recipe Book Build System Design Specification

This system was originally conceived to convert a directory of LaTeX recipe files into a compiled recipe book, following "convention over configuration" principles.

My goal is to make this system generic and reusable for other projects.

## System Overview

The build system processes individual LaTeX recipe files into a cohesive book by:
1. Detecting sections from directory structure
2. Extracting content and package requirements
3. Preprocessing content for consistency
4. Assembling and compiling a final book

## Directory Structure
```
.
├── _templates/          
│   └── misc.tex        # misc recipe templates
├── _tools/             
│   ├── build.py        # Main entry point and orchestration
│   ├── scan.py         # Directory/file scanner
│   ├── extract.py      # Content/package extractor
│   ├── preprocess.py   # Content normalizer
│   ├── compile.py      # Book assembler
│   ├── book.tex.jinja  # Master template (jinja2)
│   └── book.yml        # Main configuration
├── _build/             # Build artifacts (git-ignored)
│   ├── metadata.yml    # Build state tracking
│   └── bodies/         # Preprocessed tex content
├── [##-]section_name/  # Content directories
│   └── recipe.tex      # Source files
```

## Conventions

### Directory Names
- Directories starting with `_` are system/build related
- All other directories are automatically detected as book sections
- Optional numeric prefix in directory names (e.g., "01-appetizers")
  - Prefixes are stripped in final output
  - Used only for developer organization
- Directory names are converted to section titles
  - Underscores/hyphens converted to spaces
  - Case properly titleized
- Sections sorted alphabetically in final book

### Source Files
- Each recipe is a complete LaTeX document
- Content between \begin{document} and \end{document} is extracted
- Package requirements are detected and consolidated

## Configuration Files

### _tools/book.yml

Static book definition containing:
```yaml
title: "Family Cookbook"
authorship:
  author: "Your Name"
  version: "2024 Edition"
  copyright: "2024"
template: "book.tex.jinja"
style:
  documentclass: "article"
  size: "letterpaper"
  base_font_size: "11pt"
  twoside: true
  include_toc: true
  include_index: false
  geometry:
    top: 1in
    bottom: 1in
    left: 1.4in
    right: 1.5in
  font:
    family: "Doves Type"
    scale: 1.4
    auto_fake_bold: 1.5
    auto_fake_slant: 0.3
build:
  output_dir: "_build"  # Build directory for all artifacts
latex_compiler: "xelatex"  # LaTeX compiler to use
```

### _build/metadata.yml

Dynamic build state tracking:

```yaml
# last build timestamp, used to determine if recipes have been updated by comparing source file mtimes
last_build: "2024-03-16T15:30:00Z"
# packages are detected from the recipe source files, and consolidated into a single list
packages:
  - fontspec
  - tocloft
  - multicol
  - graphicx
  - geometry
  - inputenc
# recipe list in no particular order
recipes:
  "01-entrees/pot_roast.tex":
    section: "01-entrees"
    mtime: "2024-03-15T10:20:00Z"
    title: "Classic Pot Roast"
    packages:
      - enumitem
    extracted_body: "_build/bodies/01-entrees/pot_roast.tex"
    preprocessed: true
  "02-desserts/kettle_corn.tex":
    section: "02-desserts"
    mtime: "2024-03-15T10:20:00Z"
    title: "Kettle Corn"
    packages:
      - enumitem
    extracted_body: "_build/bodies/02-desserts/kettle_corn.tex"
    preprocessed: false
  "sides/green_bean_casserole.tex":
    section: "sides"
    mtime: "2024-03-15T10:20:00Z"
    title: "Green Bean Casserole"
    packages:
      - enumitem
    extracted_body: "_build/bodies/sides/green_bean_casserole.tex"
    preprocessed: false
# Section list in order of appearance in book, with titles converted to spaces and titleized
sections:
  "01-entrees": "Entrees"
  "02-desserts": "Desserts and Snacks"
  "sides": "Sides"  
```

## Build Pipeline

### 1. scan.py
- Discovers all tex files in content directories
- Checks modification times against previous build
- Updates metadata with file information
- Ignores system directories (starting with `_` or `.`)
- Provides rich console output with scan summary including:
  - Total sections and recipes
  - Changed recipe count
  - Error tracking
- Maintains metadata structure:
```yaml
last_build: "2024-03-16T15:30:00Z"
recipes:
  "path/to/recipe.tex":
    section: "section_name"
    mtime: "2024-03-15T10:20:00Z"
    title: "Recipe Title"
    packages: []
    extracted_body: false
    preprocessed: false
    changed: true  # Indicates if file changed since last scan
sections:
  "section_dir": "Section Title"
scan_errors:  # Tracks any errors during scanning
  - section: "directory_scan"
    error: "Error message"
    type: "ErrorType"
```

### 2. extract.py
- Extracts content between \begin{document} and \end{document}
- Identifies package requirements from \usepackage statements
- Extracts recipe title from \title{} command if present
- Updates metadata with:
  - List of required packages per recipe
  - Global consolidated package list
  - Path to extracted content file
  - Recipe title
  - Extraction errors if any occur
- Stores extracted content in _build/bodies/ maintaining source directory structure
- Provides rich console output with extraction summary including:
  - Total recipe count
  - Successfully processed count
  - Error count
  - Detailed tables showing:
    - Recipe processing status by section
    - Any errors encountered with type and message
- Maintains metadata structure:
```yaml
recipes:
  "path/to/recipe.tex":
    packages: []  # List of required packages
    extracted_body: "_build/bodies/path/to/recipe.tex"
    title: "Recipe Title"  # Extracted from \title{} command
packages: []  # Global consolidated package list
extraction_errors:  # Tracks any errors during extraction
  - recipe: "path/to/recipe.tex"
    error: "Error message"
    type: "ErrorType"
```

### 3. preprocess.py
- Normalizes extracted content
- Cleans up formatting
- Prepares content for inclusion in master template
- Updates metadata with preprocessing status

### 4. compile.py
- Reads master template from `_tools/book.tex.jinja`
- Validates build state and dependencies
- Consolidates required LaTeX packages
- Renders template with:
  - Book metadata (title, author, etc)
  - Style configuration
  - Recipe content by section
- Generates index if configured
- Runs specified LaTeX compiler
- Provides detailed compilation summary including:
  - Recipe inclusion status
  - Package usage
  - Compilation errors
  - Output file location

### build.py
- Main entry point
- Orchestrates pipeline execution
- Handles errors and logging
- Ensures clean state between runs

## Development Guidelines

1. Each script should be independently runnable with command-line arguments
2. Scripts should update metadata.yml with their state
3. Build process should be incremental (only process changed files)
4. All build artifacts go in _build directory
5. Source files remain unchanged
6. Error handling should be clear and actionable
7. Rich console output should provide clear status and error information

## Usage

Basic build:
```bash
python _tools/build.py [--config path/to/config]
```

Individual steps can be run for development:
```bash
python _tools/scan.py [--config path/to/config]
python _tools/extract.py [--config path/to/config]
python _tools/preprocess.py [--config path/to/config]
python _tools/compile.py [--config path/to/config]
```
