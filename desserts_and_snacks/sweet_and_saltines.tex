    Saltine crackers \dotfill 2-3 sleeves \\
    Kerrygold butter \dotfill 2 sticks (1 cup) \\

\section*{Directions}

\noindent
Preheat oven to \textit{425°F} ---
Line a large cookie sheet with foil and \textbf{cooking spray}---
Prepare a second large cookie sheet with crushed ice ---
Crush \textbf{nuts} and/or \textbf{pretzels} ---
Break apart candy bars into 1" pieces ---
Have a candy thermometer ready

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Arrange \textbf{saltine crackers} in a single layer, salt side down, on the prepared sheet.
    \item In a medium saucepan, combine \textbf{butter} and \textbf{brown sugar}.
    \item Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter is completely melted and the sugar is dissolved.
    \item Once the mixture starts to bubble, stop stirring and let it cook undisturbed. Cook until it reaches \textit{285°F} (soft-crack stage) on a candy thermometer, about \textit{3-5~minutes}. Watch for visual cues: the caramel should be a deep golden brown color and have a smooth, glossy appearance. You may see wisps of smoke starting to form.
    \item Immediately remove from heat and pour evenly over the arranged \textbf{crackers}. Work quickly as the caramel will start to set.
    \item Bake for \textit{3-5~minutes} until the caramel is bubbly all over. Watch carefully.
    \item Remove from oven and quickly arrange \textbf{chocolate} over the top.
    \item Wait about \textit{1~minute}, then spread the melted chocolate evenly.
    \item Sprinkle crushed \textbf{nuts} and/or \textbf{pretzels} over the melted chocolate.
    \item To cool quickly, place the hot cookie sheet with the crackers on top of the ice-filled sheet. For faster setting, place in the freezer if possible.
    \item Once cold but not frozen, break into pieces.
    \item Store in an airtight container.
\end{enumerate}
